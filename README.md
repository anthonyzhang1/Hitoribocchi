# Hitoribocchi (一人ぼっち)
Hitoribocchi is an iOS flashcard application that uses a spaced repetition system and was very heavily inspired by Anki. \
You can create flashcard decks, create flashcards of different types (e.g. basic or multiple choice), delete flashcards, search for flashcards, review flashcards, and maybe more.

Hitoribocchi uses Swift, UIKit, and Core Data. Core Data is used to store the decks/cards and their metadata, e.g. their due dates. \
Hitoribocchi was created for my university's iOS Application Development course in Fall 2022.

The `Documents` folder holds the various reports/writeups I submitted.

#### Note: You most likely need Xcode, and therefore a macOS computer, to run Hitoribocchi. Furthermore, Hitoribocchi looks best on an iPhone 14, as that was what I used on Xcode to run the application.

# Installation Instructions
**Step 1:** Clone this repository to your computer. \
**Step 2:** Open the project in Xcode. \
**Step 3:** Run the application.

#### The setup is finished. You can now launch Hitoribocchi at any time by running the application in Xcode.

When you use Hitoribocchi for the first time after installation, you will not have any decks nor flashcards. Start by pressing the + button in the top right to add a deck, then click on the newly created deck to begin adding flashcards.

Also, the application sometimes prints cryptic messages to Xcode's console; I am not sure how to fix that. Just try to ignore it.
